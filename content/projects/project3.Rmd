# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.

```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
glimpse(gss)
```

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. 

## Twitter, by education level

We estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascneding order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

```{r}
gss_twitter <- gss %>%
  # Turn degree into a factor variable 
  mutate(degree = factor(degree, 
                         levels = c("Lt high school", "High School", 
                                    "Junior college", "Bachelor", "Graduate"), 
                         ordered = TRUE)) %>%
  # Create new variable bachelor_graduate
  mutate(bachelor_graduate = 
           ifelse(degree >= "Bachelor", "Yes", 
                 ifelse(degree == "NA", "NA", "No"))) %>% 
  # Calculate upper and lower level for 95% confidence interval 
  # using CI formula for proportions
 summarize(answered = count(bachelor_graduate != "NA"), 
            answered_yes = count(bachelor_graduate == "Yes"), 
            prop_yes = answered_yes/ answered, 
            prop_no = 1- prop_yes, 
            se_yes = sqrt(prop_yes*(1-prop_yes)/answered), 
            se_no = sqrt(prop_no*(1-prop_no)/answered)) %>%
 summarize(prop_yes, 
            prop_no, 
            lower95_yes = prop_yes - 0.95*se_yes, 
            upper95_yes = prop_yes + 0.95 *se_yes, 
            lower95_no = prop_no - 0.95*se_no, 
            upper95_no = prop_no + 0.95 *se_no)

gss_twitter
```

As you can see, the confidence intervals for bachelor graduates using twitter and bachelor graduates not using twitter donâ€™t overlap. Indeed, both confidence intervals are very small.
